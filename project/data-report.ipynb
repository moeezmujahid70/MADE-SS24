    "### Data Pipeline Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to study the effect of CO2 emissions on temperature variations, the  (ETL) process is automated by the data pipeline for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technology Utilized\n",
    "- **Extraction:** Python libraries that download and manage World Bank and FAO datasets via the `requests` , `Pandas`library.\n",
    "- **Transform:** Pandas library for appplying meanigful transformation, normalization, and data cleaning.\n",
    "- **Load:** A SQLite database is being loaded from the transformed data in order to store the final data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract Data**\n",
    "    - **Description:** The pipeline pulls data from World Bank and FAO database sources. After downloading and extracting the zip file containing both datasets.\n",
    "    - **Result:** The raw data files are first downloded locally using the `requests` library and kept in data directory with files  named `fao_data.zip` and `world_bank_data.zip`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transform Data**\n",
    "    - **Description:** The data from the sources are changed normalized with meanigful transformations for consistancy.  Both datasets have been combined using common keys in them  like `year` and `Area` . All required data cleaning techniques are carried out, including managing missing values and standardizing data formats.\n",
    "    - **Result:** After the data is combined and tranformed, a merged table called `tempCO2` is produced.\n",
    "    - **Steps in Transformation:**\n",
    "        - **Convert FAO Temperature Information:**\n",
    "            - Only keeping  the records  where there is a temperature variation remove standard daviation category.\n",
    "            - Eliminate not useful columns like \"Area Code,\" \"Area Code (M49),\" \"Element Code,\" \"Months Code,\" \"Unit,\" and \"Element as these columns have no real purpose in the analysis\"\n",
    "            - Use `pd.melt()` to reshape the data from wide to long format as it will be useful to time series analysis.\n",
    "            - Eliminating 'Y' from column name as it is ambeded in years e.g Y1998 -> 1998.\n",
    "            - Compile annual data by calculating the average annual temperature change from given months.\n",
    "        - **Transform World Bank CO2 Data:**\n",
    "            - Rename columns (such as \"Country Name\" to \"Area\") to maintain consistency between datasets.\n",
    "            - Eliminate columns like \"Indicator Code\" and \"Indicator Name as they they serve no usecase in our analysis\"\n",
    "            - Use `pd.melt()` to reshape the data from wide to long format useful for time series analysis.\n",
    "            - Remove records where the CO2 emission numbers are absent.\n",
    "            - Convert the 'year' and 'co2_emissions' data types to achive consistancy.\n",
    "            - Rename column names  to keep everything uniform between data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load Data**\n",
    "    - **Description:**  SQLite database is used to load the transformed data .\n",
    "    - **Output:** An SQLite database (`pipelineDB.sqlite`) with a tables (`tempCO2`) (`temperature`) and (`CO2_emissions`) containing the transformed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems Encountered and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem:** Data formats and columns vary throughout the two diffrent datasets .\n",
    "   - **Solution:** To guarantee consistency and make the dataset mergable, standardized data formats  and column names were used during the transformation stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem:**  missing values in important columns.\n",
    "   - **Solution:** Either eliminated records  or used imputation techniques to fill in missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling and Changing Input Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Handling:**\n",
    "  - **Logging:** logging was implemented to catch any errors or debug later for potential issues.\n",
    "  - **exceptions:** Try catch exception handlers were used throughout the code to prevent breakage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Changing Input Data:**\n",
    "  - **Flexible Parsing:** used flexible data processing techniques to allow for small format changes in data without causing pipeline flow."
