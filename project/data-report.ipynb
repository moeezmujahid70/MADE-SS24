    "### Data Pipeline Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The data pipeline for this project automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process to analyze the impact of CO2 emissions on temperature changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technologies Used\n",
    "- **Extraction:** Python scripts using the `requests` library for downloading datasets from FAO and World Bank.\n",
    "- **Transformation:** Pandas library for data cleaning, normalization, and transformation.\n",
    "- **Loading:** SQLite database for storing the processed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract Data**\n",
    "    - **Description:** The pipeline extracts data from FAO and World Bank sources. Both datasets are downloaded as a zip file and extracted.\n",
    "    - **Output:** Raw data files (`fao_data.zip`, `world_bank_data.zip`) are stored locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transform Data**\n",
    "    - **Description:** The raw data is cleaned and transformed. The FAO dataset is renamed for clarity, and both datasets are merged based on common keys such as 'year' and 'country'. Any necessary data cleaning operations, such as handling missing values and normalizing data formats, are performed.\n",
    "    - **Output:** A transformed table  (`tempCO2`) is created, containing the merged and cleaned data.\n",
    "    - **Transformation Steps:**\n",
    "        - **Transform FAO Temperature Data:**\n",
    "          - Keep only the rows that contain temperature change.\n",
    "          - Drop irrelevant columns such as 'Area Code', 'Area Code (M49)', 'Element Code', 'Months Code', 'Unit', and 'Element'.\n",
    "          - Filter the data to keep only the desired months.\n",
    "          - Drop forecast columns for each year and keep only the rows with estimated values.\n",
    "          - Reshape the data from wide to long format using `pd.melt()`.\n",
    "          - Remove 'Y' from each year and convert the datatype to int.\n",
    "          - Aggregate to yearly data by taking the mean temperature change for each year.\n",
    "        - **Transform World Bank CO2 Data:**\n",
    "          - Rename columns for consistency (e.g., 'Country Name' to 'Area').\n",
    "          - Drop unnecessary columns such as 'Indicator Name' and 'Indicator Code'.\n",
    "          - Reshape the data from wide to long format using `pd.melt()`.\n",
    "          - Drop rows with missing CO2 emission values.\n",
    "          - Convert data types for 'year' and 'co2_emissions'.\n",
    "          - Rename columns to maintain consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load Data**\n",
    "    - **Description:** The transformed data is loaded into an SQLite database. This step ensures that the data is stored in a structured and queryable format, facilitating further analysis.\n",
    "    - **Output:** An SQLite database (`pipelineDB.sqlite`) with a tables (`tempCO2`) (`temperature`) and (`CO2_emissions`) containing the transformed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems Encountered and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem:** Inconsistent data formats across datasets.\n",
    "  - **Solution:** Standardized data formats during the transformation step to ensure consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem:** Missing values in critical columns.\n",
    "  - **Solution:** Applied imputation techniques to fill missing values where possible, or removed records with insufficient data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling and Changing Input Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Handling:**\n",
    "  - **Logging:** Implemented comprehensive logging to track errors at each step of the pipeline.\n",
    "  - **Retries:** Configured Airflow to automatically retry failed tasks up to a specified number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Changing Input Data:**\n",
    "  - **Flexible Parsing:** Used flexible data parsing techniques to accommodate minor changes in data format without breaking the pipeline.\n"

    "- **Data Availability:** The datasets may not cover all countries or all years uniformly, leading to potential gaps in the analysis. This could affect the comprehensiveness of the results.\n",
    "- **Data Quality:** Despite cleaning, some data inaccuracies may remain due to original source errors. There might be inconsistencies in how data was recorded or reported by different countries.\n",
    "- **Temporal Resolution:** The data is annual, which may not capture short-term variations or trends. More granular data could provide better insights but is not available in this case.\n",
    "- **Licensing and Usage:** While the data is publicly available and used in accordance with licensing agreements, there may be limitations on its commercial use or redistribution.\n",
    "- **Data Integration:** Combining datasets from different sources introduces challenges in ensuring that the merged data is harmonized correctly. Differences in data collection methods, definitions, and units can cause integration issues."
